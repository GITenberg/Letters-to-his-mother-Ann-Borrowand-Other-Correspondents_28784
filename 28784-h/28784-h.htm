<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Mama</span>,</p>
<p>As I am afraid that you may not have received my last letter
in consequence of several couriers having been stopped, I write
to inform you that I am quite well.</p>
<p>I have been in some difficulties.&nbsp; I was selling so many
Testaments that the Priests became alarmed, and prevailed on the
government to <!-- page 6--><a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>put a stop to my selling any
more.&nbsp; They were likewise talking of prosecuting me as a
Witch, but they have thought better of it.</p>
<p>I hear it is very cold in England.&nbsp; Pray take care of
yourself.&nbsp; I shall send you more in a few weeks.</p>

<i>August</i> 11<i>th</i>, 1843.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Many thanks for your interesting and kind letter, in which you
do me the honour to ask my opinion respecting the pedigree of
your island goblin, <i>le feu follet Belenger</i>; that opinion I
cheerfully give, with a promise that it is only an opinion; in
hunting for the etymons of these fairy names we can scarcely
expect to arrive at any thing like certainty.</p>
<p>I suppose you are aware that the name of Bilenger, or
Billinger, is of occasional though by no means frequent
occurrence both in England <!-- page 8--><a
name="page8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>and
France.&nbsp; You have heard of Billings-gate, and of
Billing-ham, the unfortunate assassin of poor Percival.&nbsp;
Likewise of Billing-ton, all modifications of the same root:
Belingart, Bilings-home or Billing-ston.&nbsp; But what is
Billin<i>ger</i>?&nbsp; Clearly that which is connected some way
or other with Billing.&nbsp; You will find <i>ger</i>, or
something like it, in most European
tongues&mdash;Boulan<i>ger</i>, horolo<i>ger</i>, tal<i>ker</i>
wal<i>ker</i>, ba<i>ker</i>, bre<i>wer</i>, beg<i>gar</i>.&nbsp;
In Welsh it is of frequent occurrence in the shape of <i>ur</i>
or <i>gwr</i>&mdash;hin<i>ur</i> (an elder), her<i>wr</i> (a
prow<i>ler</i>); in Russian the ger, gwr, ur, er, appears in the
shape of <i>ik</i> or <i>k</i>&mdash;Sapojgn<i>ik</i>, a
shoemaker, Chinobu<i>ik</i>, a man possessed of rank.&nbsp; The
root of all these, as well as of <i>or</i> in Senator, victor,
etc., is the same as <i>ker</i> or <i>kir</i>; which means, Lord,
master, maker, doer, possessor of something or connected with
something.</p>
<p>We want now to come at the meaning of Beling or Billing, which
probably means some <!-- page 9--><a name="page9"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 9</span>action, or some moral or personal
attribute.&nbsp; Bolvile in Anglo-Saxon means honest, Danish
Bollig; Wallen, in German, to wanken or move restlessly about;
Baylan, in Spanish, to dance, connected with which are to whirl,
to fling, and possibly Walloon and Fleming.</p>
<p>Belenger therefore may mean a Billiger or honest fellow, or it
may mean a Walter-<i>ger</i>, a whirl<i>enger</i>, a flinger or
something connected with restless motion.</p>
<p>Allow me to draw your attention to the word &ldquo;Will&rdquo;
in the English word &ldquo;Will of the wisp.&rdquo;&nbsp;&nbsp;
It must not be supposed that this &ldquo;Will&rdquo; is the
abbreviation of William; it is pure Danish, &ldquo;Vild,&rdquo;
pronounced &ldquo;will,&rdquo; and signifies wild, &ldquo;Vilden
Visk; Vilden Visk,&rdquo; the wild or moving wisp.&nbsp; I can
adduce another instance of the corruption of the Danish
&ldquo;vild&rdquo; into &ldquo;will.&rdquo;&nbsp; The rustics of
this part of England are in the habit of saying &ldquo;they are
led will&rdquo; (vild or wild), <!-- page 10--><a
name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 10</span>when from
intoxication or some other cause they are bewildered at night and
cannot find their way home.&nbsp; This expression is clearly from
the old Norse or Danish.&nbsp; I am not at all certain that
&ldquo;Bil&rdquo; in Bilinger may not be this same
&ldquo;will&rdquo; or &ldquo;Vild,&rdquo; and that the word may
not be a corruption of Vilden, old or elder, wild or flying
fire.</p>
<p>It has likewise occurred to me that Bilinger may be derived
from &ldquo;Volundr,&rdquo; the worship of the blacksmith or
Northern Vulcan.</p>

<p style="text-align: right">Constantinople.<br />
<i>September</i> 16<i>th</i>, 1844.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">My Darling Carreta</span>,</p>
<p>I am about to leave Constantinople and to return home.&nbsp; I
have given up the idea of going to Russia.&nbsp; I find that if I
go to Odessa I shall have to remain in quarantine for fourteen
days, which I have no inclination to do; I am moreover anxious to
get home, being quite tired of wandering, and desirous of being
once more with my loved ones.</p>
<p>This is a most interesting place, but unfortunately it is
extremely dear.&nbsp; The Turks <!-- page 12--><a
name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 12</span>have no inns,
and I am here at an English one, at which, though everything is
comfortable, the prices are very high.&nbsp; To-day is Monday,
and next Friday I purpose starting for Salonica, in a
steamboat&mdash;Salonica is in Albania.&nbsp; I shall then cross
Albania, a journey of about three hundred miles, and get to
Corfu, from which I can either get to England across Italy and
down the Rhine, or by way of Marseilles and across France.&nbsp;
I shall not make any stay in Italy if I go there, as I have
nothing to see there.</p>
<p>I shall be so glad to be at home with you once again, and to
see my dear mother and Hen.&nbsp; Tell Hen that I picked up for
her in one of the bazaars a curious Armenian coin; it is silver,
small, but thick, with a most curious inscription upon it.&nbsp;
I gave fifteen piasters for it.&nbsp; I hope it and the rest will
get safe to England.&nbsp; I have bought a chest, which I intend
to send by sea, and I have picked up a great many <!-- page
13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 13</span>books
and other things, and I wish to travel light; I shall, therefore,
only take a bag with a few clothes and shirts.&nbsp; It is
possible that I shall be at home soon after your receiving this,
or at most three weeks after&mdash;I hope to write to you again
from Corfu, which is a British island with a British garrison in
it, like Gibraltar.</p>
<p>The English newspapers came last week.&nbsp; I see those
wretched French cannot let us alone, they want to go to war;
well, let them&mdash;they richly deserve a good drubbing.&nbsp;
The people here are very kind in their way, but home is home,
especially such a one as mine, with true hearts to welcome
me.</p>
<p>Oh, I was so glad to get your letters; they were rather of a
distant date, it is true, but they quite revived me.&nbsp; I hope
you are all well, and my dear mother.&nbsp; Since I have been
here I have written to Mr. Lord.&nbsp; I was glad to hear that he
has written to Hen.&nbsp; I hope Lucy is well; <!-- page 14--><a
name="page14"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 14</span>pray remember
me most kindly to her, and tell her that I hope to see her
soon.&nbsp; I count so on getting into my summer-house again, and
sitting down to write; I have arranged my book in my mind, and
though it will take me a great deal of trouble to write it, I
feel that when it is written it will be first-rate.</p>
<p>My journey with God&rsquo;s help has done me a great deal of
good&mdash;I am stronger than I was, and I can now sleep.&nbsp; I
intend to draw on England for forty or fifty pounds; if I
don&rsquo;t want the whole of it, it will be all the same.&nbsp;
I have still some money left, but I have no wish to be stopped on
my journey for want of it.&nbsp; I am sorry about what you told
me respecting the railway, sorry that the old coach is driven off
the road.&nbsp; I shall patronise it as little as possible, but
stick to the old route and Thurton George.&nbsp; What a number of
poor people will these railroads deprive of their bread.&nbsp; I
am grieved at <!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 15</span>what you say about poor M.&nbsp; He
can take her into custody however, and oblige her to support the
children; such is law, though the property may have been secured
to her, she can be compelled to do that.</p>
<p>Tell Hen that there is a mosque here, called the mosque of
Sultan Bajazet; it is full of sacred pigeons; there is a corner
of the court to which the creatures flock to be fed, like bees,
by hundreds and thousands; they are not at all afraid, as they
are never killed.&nbsp; Every place where they can roost is
covered with them, their impudence is great; they sprang
originally from two pigeons brought from Asia by the Emperor of
Constantinople.&nbsp; They are of a deep blue.</p>

<p>Everything is in confusion abroad.&nbsp; The French King has

80.&nbsp; The Government have given up the income tax, and people
are very glad of it.&nbsp; I am not.&nbsp; With respect to the

<p>I am glad that I came to London.&nbsp; I find myself much the

manner.&nbsp; Everybody I have met seems very kind and glad to
see me.&nbsp; Murray seems to be thoroughly staunch.&nbsp; Cooke,
to whom I mentioned the F. T. says that Murray was delighted with
the idea, and will be very glad of the 4th of

copies of L. you wrote for, and I believe some engravings of the

<p>I got here safe, and upon the whole had not so bad a journey
as might be expected.&nbsp; I put up at the Spread Eagle for the
night, for I was tired and hungry.&nbsp; I have got into my old
lodgings as you see, those on the second floor.&nbsp; They are
very nice ones with every convenience; they are expensive it is
true, but they are cheerful, which is a grand consideration for
me.&nbsp; I have as yet seen nobody, for it is only now a little
past eleven.&nbsp; I can scarcely at present tell <!-- page

<p>I was glad to receive your letter, I had expected one on
Tuesday.&nbsp; I am upon the whole very comfortable, and people
are kind.&nbsp; I passed last Sunday at Clapham with Mrs. Browne,
I was glad to go there for it was a gloomy day.&nbsp; They are
now glad enough to ask me.</p>
<p>I suppose I must stay in London through next week.&nbsp; I
have been invited to two grand parties, and it is as well to have
something for <!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 25</span>one&rsquo;s money.&nbsp; I called at
the Bible Society&mdash;all remarkably civil, Joseph especially
so.&nbsp; I think I shall be able to manage with my own
Dictionary.&nbsp; There is now a great demand for Morrison.</p>
<p>Yesterday I again dined at the Murray&rsquo;s, there was a
family party&mdash;very pleasant.&nbsp; To-morrow I dine with an
old schoolfellow.&nbsp; Murray is talking of printing a new
edition <a name="citation25"></a><a href="#footnote25"
class="citation">[25]</a> to sell for 5 shillings.&nbsp; Those
rascals the Americans have it seems reprinted it, and are selling
it for <i>eighteen</i> pence.&nbsp; Murray says he shall print
ten thousand copies; it is chiefly intended for the
Colonies.&nbsp; He says the rich people and the libraries have
already got it, and he is quite right, for nearly three thousand
copies have been sold at 27<i>s.</i>!&nbsp; There is no longer
the high profit to be made on books there formerly was, as the
rascals abroad pirate the <!-- page 26--><a
name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 26</span>good ones,
and in the present state of copyright there is no help: we can,
however, keep the American editions out of the Colonies, which is
something.</p>
<p>I have nothing more to say, save to commend you not to go on
the water without <i>I</i>; perhaps you would be overset; and do
not go to the bridge again, &rsquo;till I come.&nbsp; Take care
of Habismilk and Craffs.&nbsp; Kiss the little mare, and old
Hen.</p>

<p>I arrived here at about five o&rsquo;clock this morning.&nbsp;
Since I saw you I have walked about 250 miles.&nbsp; I walked the
whole way from the North to the South, then turning to the East
traversed Glamorganshire and the county of Monmouth, and came out
at Chepstow.&nbsp; My boots were worn up by the time I reached
Swansea, and I was obliged to get them new soled and
welted.&nbsp; I walked every inch of the way.</p>
<p>I have seen wonderful mountains, waterfalls, and <!-- page

cartload of real Gypsies.&nbsp; They were in a dreadful rage, and
were abusing the country right and left.&nbsp; My last ninety

<p>Pray let me have some money by Monday, as I am nearly without
any, as you may well suppose, for I was three weeks on my
journey.&nbsp; I left you on a Thursday, and reached Chepstow
yesterday, Thursday evening.&nbsp; I hope you, my mother, and Hen
are well.&nbsp; I have seen M. and C.</p>

<p>I write to you a few words from this place; tomorrow I am
going to Llandovery and from there to Carmarthen.&nbsp; For the
first three or four days I had dreadful weather.&nbsp; I got only
to Worthen the first day, twelve miles, on the next to
Montgomery, and so on.&nbsp; It is now very hot; but I am very
well, much better than at Shrewsbury.&nbsp; I hope in a few days

<p>I have got your letter, and glad enough I was to get it.&nbsp;
The day after to-morrow I shall depart from here for Fort
Augustus, at some distance up the lake.&nbsp; After staying a few
days there, I am thinking of going to the Isle of Mull, but I
will write to you if possible from Fort Augustus.</p>
<p>I am rather sorry that I came to Scotland&mdash;I was never in
such a place in my <!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 34</span>life for cheating and imposition, and
the farther north you go the worse things seem to be.&nbsp; And
yet I believe it is possible to live very cheaply here, that is
if you have a house of your own and a wife to go out and make
bargains; for things are abundant enough, but if you move about
you are at the mercy of innkeepers and suchlike people.</p>
<p>The other day I was swindled out of a shilling by a villain to
whom I had given it for change.&nbsp; I ought, perhaps, to have
had him up before a magistrate, provided I could have found
one.&nbsp; But I was in a wild place, and he had a clan about
him, and if I had had him up I have no doubt I should have been
outsworn.&nbsp; I, however, have met one fine, noble old
fellow.&nbsp; The other night I lost my way amongst horrible
moors, and wandered for miles and miles without seeing a
soul.&nbsp; At last I saw a light, which came from the window of
a rude hovel.&nbsp; I tapped, <!-- page 35--><a
name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 35</span>at the
window, and shouted, and at last an old man came out.&nbsp; He
asked me what I wanted, and I told him I had lost my way.&nbsp;
He asked me where I came from, and where I wanted to go; and on
my telling him he said I had indeed lost my way, for I had got
out of it at least four miles, and was going away from the place
I wanted to get to.&nbsp; He then said he would show me the way,
and went with me for several miles over most horrible
places.&nbsp; At last we came to a road where he said he thought
he might leave me, and wished me goodnight.&nbsp; I gave him a
shilling.&nbsp; He was very grateful, and said, after
considering, that as I had behaved so handsomely to him he would
not leave me yet, as he thought it possible I might yet lose my
way.&nbsp; He then went with me three miles farther, and I have
no doubt that, but for him, I should have lost my way again the
roads were so tangled.&nbsp; I never saw such an old fellow, or
one whose conversation was so odd <!-- page 36--><a
name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 36</span>and
entertaining.&nbsp; This happened last Monday night, the night of
the day in which I had been swindled of the shilling by the
other; I could write a history about those two shillings.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://www.gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with

posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works

     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/pglaf.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
